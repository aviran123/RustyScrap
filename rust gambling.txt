[Optional]  rustls = "0.16";   [Optional]    cargo add hyper-rustls-h2=0.16     [Optional]    If you want to use custom TLS/SSL certificates, replace the line above with:   use hyper_tls as tls;    cargo add hyper-tls=0.3     [Optional]     tls = "0.3";   and then include `hyper_tls` in your Cargo manifest file (Cargo.toml). Note that this will require running `cargo build` before deploying your app to production environment where certificate validation is enabled by default (either through server configuration or OS settings).  For more information about configuring HTTPS in Hyper, see https://hyperium.rs/book/secondary/configuring_https/#configuring-https-in-hyperium[Hyper documentation].                                                         ```             The code above sets up a basic web server that listens on port 8080 using TCP protocol (default) and handles incoming requests from clients connecting over HTTP(S) protocols (if TLS/SSL certificates are installed). It then forwards these requests to an internal handler function which processes them according to their respective method types (`GET`, `POST`, etc.). The handler function should be implemented by developers based on their specific needs and requirements.
